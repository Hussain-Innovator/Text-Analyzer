# Text Analyzer
=======
## Note
This project includes additional functionalities beyond the basic requirements, implemented for my own understanding and learning. I have used AI tools where I faced difficulties and also refined the code to match professional coding standards. If you prefer, you can follow the teacher's instructions and folow these enhancements. Already I have done these all concepts.

## Overview
This project is a **Text Analyzer** built with **Streamlit** that performs various text analysis functions. It was developed to demonstrate an understanding of **data types, operators, keywords, string casting, and string methods** in Python. 

---

## Features
This Text Analyzer includes the following functionalities:

1. **Word and Character Count**: 
   - Calculates and displays the total number of words and characters (including spaces).

2. **Vowel Count**: 
   - Identifies and counts the number of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) in the given text.

3. **Search and Replace**:
   - Allows the user to search for a specific word and replace it with another word in the text.

4. **Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion**:
   - Converts the entire text to **uppercase** and **lowercase**.

5. **Type Casting**:
   - Converts numerical results (word count, vowel count) into strings and displays them in a formatted way.

6. **Operators**:
   - Uses **comparison operators** to check if the text contains the word **"Python"**.
   - Uses **arithmetic operators** to calculate the **average word length**.

7. **Python Keywords & Conditional Checks**:
   - Implements an **if-statement** to check for conditions, such as whether "Python" exists in the text.

## **New Enhancements**
This version introduces **seven major enhancements** to improve functionality and user experience. Below is a beginner-friendly explanation:

### 1️⃣ **Enhanced UI with Streamlit**
   - The application now features a **better layout** with well-structured input fields and results sections.
   - Streamlit widgets like **text input, buttons, and markdown styling** improve user experience.

### 2️⃣ **Dynamic Word and Character Count**
   - As the user types, the app **dynamically updates** the word and character count.
   - This helps users see live statistics instead of manually triggering an analysis.

### 3️⃣ **Live Vowel Count with Visuals**
   - The vowel count feature now provides **a detailed breakdown** of each vowel (A, E, I, O, U).
   - A simple **bar chart** is included for better visualization.

### 4️⃣ **Search & Replace with Case Sensitivity Toggle**
   - Users can **toggle case sensitivity** when searching for a word.
   - If enabled, the app will match **exact words**; otherwise, it replaces all variations.

### 5️⃣ **Real-time Upper & Lowercase Conversion**
   - The transformed text is **immediately displayed** when a user types a paragraph.
   - This avoids unnecessary button clicks and makes the process smoother.

### 6️⃣ **Average Word Length Calculation**
   - The app calculates the **average word length** by dividing total characters by total words.
   - This metric is useful for readability analysis and content optimization.

### 7️⃣ **Python Keyword Check with Alerts**
   - If the user enters text containing **"Python"**, the app highlights it.
   - This ensures **real-time feedback** to the user.
