# üìä Text Analyzer

## üìù Note  
This project includes additional functionalities beyond the basic requirements, implemented for my own understanding and learning. I have used AI tools where I faced difficulties and also refined the code to match professional coding standards. If you prefer, you can follow the teacher's instructions and ignore these enhancements. All concepts have already been covered.

## üåü Overview  
**Text Analyzer** is a Python-based application built with **Streamlit** that performs various text analysis functions. It was developed to demonstrate an understanding of **data types, operators, keywords, string casting, and string methods** in Python.

## üöÄ Features  
This Text Analyzer includes the following functionalities:

‚úÖ **Word & Character Count**  
- Calculates and displays the total number of words and characters (including spaces).  

‚úÖ **Vowel Count**  
- Identifies and counts the number of vowels (A, E, I, O, U) in the given text.  

‚úÖ **Search & Replace**  
- Allows users to search for a specific word and replace it with another.  

‚úÖ **Uppercase & Lowercase Conversion**  
- Converts the entire text to uppercase or lowercase.  

‚úÖ **Type Casting**  
- Converts numerical results (word count, vowel count) into strings for formatted display.  

‚úÖ **Operators Usage**  
- Uses comparison operators to check if the text contains the word "Python".  
- Uses arithmetic operators to calculate the average word length.  

‚úÖ **Python Keywords & Conditional Checks**  
- Implements an **if-statement** to check if "Python" exists in the text.
